                                <p>In this website, I divided the page into two parts using div tags, with the left side occupying 30% and the
                                     right side 70% of the space. On the right side, I embedded a looping video using video tags set to 
                                     <b>autoplay</b>, <b>loop</b>, and <b>muted</b>, while on the left side, I placed the logo using an image 
                                     tag and aligned it with <b>position: absolute</b> and a z-index of 1, positioned with <b>top</b> and
                                      <b>left</b>. Below this, I included the mission statement within a div, and at the bottom, I positioned
                                       the team members’ teddies using <b>position: absolute</b>. Additionally, I implemented a button to navigate 
                                       to the home screen, styled with <b>background-color: rgb(0, 160, 24)</b>, rounded borders via <b>border-radius:
                                         20px</b>, and padded with <b>padding: 10px 20px</b>. The button’s opacity changes on hover and when active,
                                          achieved with the CSS rules <b>.getStartedButton:hover{opacity: 0.7;}</b> and <b>.getStartedButton:active{opacity: 0.4;}</b>.</p>

                                    <p>On this webpage, I have divided it into two distinct sections. The right side features a captivating 
                                        video of a landscaped loop, while the left side prominently displays our logo along with our mission 
                                        statement. At the bottom, I have included a team member’s details. In the centre, I have placed a button
                                         that leads to the home page. To enhance user experience, I have incorporated several design elements. 
                                         When the user hovers over the button and clicks it, the button will change its colours. </p>

                                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                                <p>On this webpage, I divided the content into several sections using div elements. In the first section, I featured
                                     a looping video with text and links overlaid on top. I accomplished this by applying CSS properties such 
                                     as <b>position: relative</b> and <b>overflow: hidden</b>, while the video plays automatically, loops, and remains
                                      muted. A semi-transparent black overlay improves text visibility by using <b>position: absolute</b>, full width
                                       and height, and a background color of <b>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)</b>. Additionally, I overlaid a darker plane at the
                                        bottom that includes text and a button which scrolls to the relevant section. The button changes color on hover
                                         using the <b>:hover</b> selector and has rounded edges with <b>border-radius</b>.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The next section focuses on why people should volunteer. It features a background image set in a div with
                                     <b>width: auto</b>, <b>height: 100%</b>, and <b>position: absolute</b>. Over this image, I added a 
                                     semi-transparent white overlay by using another div that takes up 65% of the width and adjusts automatically 
                                     to different screen sizes, with the background color set to <b>rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)</b>. The overlay's text
                                      is centered using <b>text-align: center</b> and <b>position: relative</b>, styled with a font size of 
                                      <b>23px</b> and margins on both sides for spacing.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In the following section, I added a sort-by button using select and option tags. This button is positioned in the
                                     top-right corner with <b>top: 20px</b> and <b>right: 20px</b>, styled with <b>padding: 6px 12px</b> and a
                                      <b>cursor: pointer</b> to indicate interactivity. On the left side, there is text showing the number of 
                                      available volunteer programs along with a "View All" link. Below these elements, I created four program cards 
                                      using div elements with the same class. Each card features images with a hover effect that slightly enlarges 
                                      the card using the CSS rule <b>.program-card:hover { transform: scale(1.05); }</b>. Inside each card, there are
                                       two buttons labeled "View Project" and "Apply," as well as a like button that toggles to red when clicked,
                                        achieved using a JavaScript function that toggles a "liked" class.
                                    <br><br>
                                    For the final section, I created a review area divided into two parts using div elements. The left side occupies
                                     30% of the width while the right side takes up 70%, ensuring a consistent layout across devices. The right side
                                      contains two sample review boxes, and at the bottom, a text box is provided for users to type and submit their
                                       reviews. This text box is implemented using a textarea element with a placeholder that reads "Write your review here…".</p>        
                               <br>
                                       <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The webpage begins with a looping video of volunteers planting trees. Over this video, a black transparent 
                                    overlay contains interactive navigation links. When the "Volunteer Now" button is clicked, it scrolls down
                                     to the Volunteer Programs section. Clicking the "Why Volunteer Us" link navigates to a section explaining 
                                     the reasons and benefits of volunteering. The "Reviews" link takes users to the Reviews section, while the 
                                     "Team" button redirects to the Teams page, which is developed by Student 3.  <br><br>
                                    Next, the “Start Volunteering” section highlights why people should volunteer and what they gain from it.
                                     This section is divided into two parts using div tags. On the left side, a white transparent background div 
                                     ensures readability. A similar transparent styling is applied to the video and navigation links to enhance clarity.  
                                    <br><br>
                                    The “Start Volunteering ” section showcases four different volunteering programs, each represented by a card. 
                                    These cards are structured using div tags for proper organisation. A navigation panel in the left corner provides 
                                    three sorting options when clicked. Each program card is interactive—hovering over a card enlarges it for better 
                                    readability and engagement. The "View Project" and "Apply" buttons are also interactive, making it easier for users
                                     to explore and apply for programs.  
                                    <br><br>
                                    Finally, the “Reviews section” presents feedback from previous volunteers. On the left, it displays the total
                                     number of reviews, while on the right, two example reviews provide insights into volunteer experiences. Below
                                      these reviews, a feedback form allows users to submit their opinions, featuring  "Submit Feedback" and "Cancel"
                                       buttons for user convenience.</p>

                                <p>On this webpage, I set a fixed width of <b>1200px</b> for aesthetic purposes to create a balanced layout,
                                     then incorporated several images that were formatted using CSS properties such as <b>width</b> and
                                     <b>margin</b> to ensure proper spacing and alignment, while structuring the content with <b>p</b> tags 
                                     and <b>div</b> elements for a clean, professional design.</p>

                                    <p>In this webpage, I discuss the impact of <b>climate change</b> on <b>biodiversity</b>.
                                         I begin with a photo that highlights the differences between a desert and a forest, 
                                         setting the visual context for the topic. A following paragraph provides a basic introduction
                                          that outlines how <b>climate changes</b> influence various ecosystems, which leads into an 
                                          examination of the <b>effects on species diversity</b> and the resulting <b>impact on habitat 
                                            integrity</b>. The discussion then addresses the broader <b>consequences on ecological

                            <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                            <p>During this coursework, I encountered several challenges, such as learning how to
                                 properly use div elements and position items using top, bottom, left, and right properties.
                                  I also discovered the importance of using percentages instead of fixed pixels to maintain 
                                  consistent layouts across different devices. Additionally, I learned how to effectively
                                   implement video and image elements, set them as backgrounds, and loop videos. I also gained 
                                   experience in linking and applying CSS files correctly, as well as using GitHub for version
                                    control and team collaboration, among many other challenges that enriched my web development 
                                    skills.</p>
                        </section>
            
                        <section>
                            <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                            <p>In developing the webpages, I ensured compliance with Janet regulations by adopting best practices
                                 in layout, accessibility, and code structure. I used semantic HTML elements such as divs and 
                                 paragraphs to structure content logically and applied responsive design techniques—using 
                                 percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels—to guarantee consistent display across different 
                                 devices. Multimedia elements like looping videos and background images are implemented with 
                                 appropriate attributes (autoplay, loop, and muted) so that they enhance rather than distract 
                                 from the user experience. Additionally, I used overlays to improve text contrast and readability,
                                  meeting visual accessibility standards. By linking CSS files externally and using GitHub for
                                   version control and collaboration, I maintained a clean, maintainable, and secure codebase.
