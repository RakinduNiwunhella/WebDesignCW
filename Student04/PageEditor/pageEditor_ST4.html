                                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                                    <p>This HTML and CSS code builds a structured and visually appealing profile dashboard. The <b>!DOCTYPE html</b> declaration
                                       ensures HTML5 compatibility, while <b>html lang="en"</b> improves accessibility. The <b>head</b> section contains metadata,
                                       linked stylesheets (<b>link rel="stylesheet"</b> for styleglobal.css and style.css), and a favicon. The <b>body</b> houses a
                                       wrapper <b>div class="wrapper"</b> to center content, with a <b>header</b> containing a logo and a navigation bar 
                                       (<b>nav</b> with <b>ul class="nav-links"</b>). The main content (<b>main</b>) is divided into three sections: a sidebar 
                                       (<b>div class="sidebar"</b>) displaying user details, skills, and profile information, a central content area 
                                       (<b>div class="main-content"</b>) containing a bio, goals, and experiences, and a right sidebar (<b>div class="right-sidebar"</b>)
                                       for availability, UN goals, and a contact form. Visual enhancements include skill and goal bars 
                                       (<b>div class="skill-bar"</b> and <b>div class="goal-bar"</b>) with progress indicators. The CSS ensures a responsive design, using
                                       flexbox for layout (.container { display: flex; }), background properties (background-size: cover; background-position:
                                       center;), and box shadows (<b>box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)</b>;) for modern styling. The <b>footer</b> contains additional
                                       navigation links and credits, enhancing usability and structure. </p> 
                                
                                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                                    <p>The profile dashboard boosts accessibility with its use of semantic HTML, making it more navigable through screen readers.
                                       Alt tags on images help contextualize them better, and the use of meaningful link text adds to the navigation. 
                                        Readable font types and contrasting colors make it more comfortable for readers, while traversable via the keyboard
                                        makes it also very assistive for people who might fall under the mouse-disabled category.Ultimately, the responsive 
                                        layout indeed makes it usable on screens of varying sizes.Introduction of ARIA attributes could perhaps improve
                                       accessibility even more, thus far not implemented.A combination of design features contributes to increasing the 
                                       inclusiveness of user experience. </p>

                                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                                    <p>The SVG design proposes an interactive navigation nature-illustrated interface by representing buttons through
                                       rectangles, labels through texts, and connection through paths. Each node is grouped using <b>g tag</b> and positioned 
                                       using transform="'translate(x,y)'". Rectangles have rounded corners and come coated in various colors-green for
                                       pages, blue for home-for differentiation needs. The text elements are centered inside the rectangles for clear
                                       visibility. The nodes are wrapped in clickable links that are made interactive with <b>a xlink:href</b>. Connections
                                       between related sections are visually made with <b>path</b>, therefore forming a structured navigation map. That 
                                       ensures clear, functional, and user-friendly design. </p> 
            
                                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                                    <p>To enhance information accessibility in the SVG navigation, contrast of all text elements was taken into
                                      consideration for user-friendly; this will assist users who have vision impairment-related disabilities in
                                      reading. Semantic grouping using <b>g</b> tags for easier assistive technology interpretation was done. All links
                                      were embedded inside <b>a </b> ;tags to allow keyboard navigation and compatibility with screen readers. Large 
                                      clickable areas on the buttons are provided for users who have motor impairments. Plus, connections between
                                      the different elements assist users in following through easily.   </p>

                            <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                                <p>In the process of implementation, one of the major challenges was in getting the clickable areas in the SVG to work as intended.
                                   Several of the links within the <b>a</b> tags were, at one time, not clickable because the anchor elements were not properly nested
                                   around the SVG shapes. The particular issue shall be solved by wrapping each of the interactive elements, such as buttons and links,
                                   inside the appropriate <b>a</b> tags. Ensuring that both the design and layout of the SVG were in line with the HTML structure presented
                                   another challenge, especially the sidebar and content sections. It could lead to a situation where there would be a difference in 
                                   the ((visual appearance of the two)). This is, however, being dealt with by using the same colors for links and working on making 
                                   the layout adaptive for other resolutions. In brief, I gained the knowledge to structurally prepare the SVG elements correctly for
                                   interactivity, while keeping a common design between HTML and SVG to have a smooth experience for the user. </p>

                                <p>The webpages I created adhere to Janet regulations by ensuring that everything was done to ensure accessibility, data privacy,
                                   and content accuracy. These include: description of images with alt text, content easy to read, and the user data being protected
                                   through simple contact forms. Through some original, accurate, and up-to-date content, basic values and principles, such as
                                   inclusion and non-discrimination, are undoubtedly promoted. With just these few principles set, further maintenance will be
                                   required to assure full compliance, particularly regarding accessibility audits and data security measures. </p>
