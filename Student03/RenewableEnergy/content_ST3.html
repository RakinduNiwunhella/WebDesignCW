        <!-- Overview of Renewable Energy -->
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Overview of Renewable Energy</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Renewable energy originates from habitual processes which maintain their ability to replenish.
             Renewables serve as better energy alternatives to fossil fuels since their supply remains 
             renewable while causing less harm to the environment. Solar power comes from sunlight while 
             wind power generates from air currents and flowing water supplies hydropower and underground 
             heat found deep in the planet generates geothermal power. This technology combination brings 
             specific benefits together with technical barriers which shape both installation and large-scale 
             expansion potential.</p>
             <br>

        <!-- Solar Energy -->
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Solar Energy: Harnessing the Power of the Sun</h2>
          <br>
          <img style="height: 300px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 15px;" src="images/solapanels.jpg" alt="sola panels">
          <p>
          Our sun is the source of energy that we need for the planet to thrive. For example, photovoltaic cells (PV) are capable of 
          turning sunlight directly into power, and can be seen on rooftops of homes. In addition, engineers have developed powerful 
          forms of concentrated solar power systems (CSP) that can harness mid-infrared radiation from solar energy. These systems use 
          mirrors or lenses that gather sunlight and focus it into a small area. Once this heat energy is concentrated, it can be used
           to produce power.</p>
           <br>
          <h3>Technology and Applications</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
          Among other places, solar panels are now commonplace on solar farms and rooftops. With the improvement in all the facets of 
          Photovoltaic (PV) technology, the efficiency rates have increased while the costs have decreased. This has made solar energy 
          competitively favorable to be used alongside solar power. The development of bifacial panels and thin film solar cells further 
          pave the way towards efficiency as well as versatility.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Benefits and Challenges</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            No emissions are produced while using solar energy, which is one of the renewable sources of energy in the world. Furthermore, 
            solar technologies can be deployed from the residential level to the planned design of multi megawatt utility solar parks. The 
            fact alone does indicate a positive solar installation metric. However, due to the fact that sun light can be inconsistent, solar 
            power can be a challenge to generate consistently. To counter that, having energy storage devices such as batteries is vital to 
            ensure there is a stable power supply, especially during the night or cloudy days. Additionally, making photovoltaic (PV) cells 
            usually contains harmful substances which need stern governing control and necessitate recycling programs.</p>

        <!-- Wind Energy -->
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Wind Energy: Turning Air into Electricity</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Wind energy uses wind turbines to convert to the kinetic energy of wind into electric power. Both onshore and offshore wind farms
             have experienced a boom in development which has been spurred by technological advancement and favorable policies.</p>
             <br>
             <img style="height: 300px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 15px;" src="images/windmils.jpg" alt="wind mills">

          <h3>Mechanisms and Deployment</h3>
          <br>

          <p>
            Modern day wind turbines are designed to produce energy effectively even at lower wind speeds. Addition of variable pitch blades and
             better control mechanisms have led to improvements in turbine designs. Offshore wind farms do face high upfront construction costs, 
             difficulty in installation and maintenance due to logistical issues, but they do get stronger and more reliable winds which make up
              for these issues.</p>
              <br>
          <h3>Environmental and Economic Considerations</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Northwestern Pacific wind energy has low operating expenses and does not greatly damage the environment, but there is criticism surrounding 
            operational noise, visual impact, and damage to bat and bird populations. Careful environmental monitoring and planning should solve these
             problems oe strategy needs to be developed for building wind turbines. Not only incorporating renewable energy is good for the economy, 
             put putting more funding into electricity projects drives growth and creates employment too.</p>

          <h3>Hydroelectric Power</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            The energy of flowing water powers turbines in hydropower. Large-scale dams, such those on important rivers, can manage flooding,
             improve agriculture, and produce a sizable quantity of electricity. Nonetheless, careful planning and management are required due 
             to the ecological effects of damming rivers, which include uprooting communities and upsetting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
             <br>
          <h3>Geothermal Energy</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Geothermal energy uses the inherent heat that the Earth contains, which is kept in subterranean reservoirs. It provides a steady 
            source of electricity regardless of weather variations. Geological circumstances play a major role in the performance of geothermal 
            plants, despite the fact that they are very efficient and emit few emissions. Geothermal exploitation is best suited for areas with 
            high levels of volcanic activity or tectonic movements, such Iceland and portions of the western United States.</p>
